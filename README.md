# Abstract
Species distribution modeling (SDM) enables conservation scientists to make range
estimates for species of concern, as well as predictions of potential range in unsampled areas
and for different time periods. Since the field’s inception, modeling and methodological best
practices continue to advance at a rapid pace, and cutting-edge techniques are increasingly
accessible only to those with advanced programming knowledge. We developed the application
Wallace EcoMod to lower the barriers for modern species distribution modeling by offering
access to the latest programmatic tools through an interactive graphical interface. Wallace
implements a range of analysis functions from existing packages in the R programming
language without necessitating any user programming knowledge. Additionally, Wallace offers
extensive guidance text that explains methodological details and theory with literature
references using simple language that benefits both new and experienced users. Each session
can be exported as a readable, documented script that can be run to reproduce the analysis in
R. The Wallace application is available in the R package `wallace`, with a single function that
opens the interface. It comes equipped with both MaxEnt and BIOCLIM algorithms for modeling
environmental suitability to estimate species’ ranges.  

In this workshop, we will review the basics of SDM using Wallace, demonstrate key application
functions, highlight some new features, and show applications to conservation science through
a brief case study. Participants will also have a chance to work with their own datasets with
instructor support. Participants should have a minimal understanding of species distribution
modeling and using R. They will use their own laptops to run Wallace for a hands-on learning
experience, and will emerge more confident SDM users.
