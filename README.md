# Abstract
This workshop will introduce participants to *Wallace EcoMod*, a modular `R`-based application for building, evaluating, and visualizing models of species niches and distributions. *Wallace* does this by guiding users through sequential steps of analysis called “components” and methodological options within each component called “modules.” The focus will be on integrating tools from R packages to customize the *Wallace v2* workflow (see requirements below). The workshop will provide an overview of *Wallace*’s functionalities and guide participants through the module authorship process, explaining the steps involved in adding a module, best practices to follow, and the occasional troubleshooting.
